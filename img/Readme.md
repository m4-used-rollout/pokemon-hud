The way sprites are managed for most generations is to use an external sprite dump of the ROM. This software can generate its own sprite dumps of generation 2 games, but relies on external dumpers for 1, 3, 4, and 5. 6 and up use the "Generic" sprites.

I didn't include any of the sprite dumps besides "generic" in the repo. You'll have to provide your own if you're attempting to get this thing running. Or use the generic sprites.
