This has been TPP's party display, API backend, and DexNav since April 2017. It's a bit of a mess and was never as easy to set up or as flexible as I wanted.

I don't have time to provide support for this software, unfortunately. But I do know some people have gotten it working.

Hopefully it'll be useful to you as a reference for reading from Pokemon games.
